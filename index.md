**I'm on the job market! Please reach out if you know of an opportunity that would fit my background.**
Hey there, I'm Bikram, a passionate MTech. student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at IIT-Jodhpur. I'm all about the thrilling blend of Probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), where I dive deep into creating cutting-edge algorithms that push the limits of Artificial General Intelligence.
During my undergraduate years at IISER Kolkata, I had the incredible opportunity to work on a fascinating project focused on cancer metastasis at the renowned [MorphogenesisLab](https://sites.google.com/view/morphogenesis-lab-iiserkolkata/about-us?authuser=0) under Prof. Mohit Prasad . This is where I realized that the best way to cure cancer is early detection. It was within the fascinating realm of cancer metastasis research that I had my "eureka" moment â€” the realization that early detection holds the key to conquering this formidable disease. Witnessing the initial triumphs of Deep Learning in diagnosing cancer from images ignited an unquenchable fire within me.

Fuelled by a relentless desire for knowledge and skill enhancement, I immersed myself in ML specialized courses on platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). What began as months of dedicated learning soon transformed into an enchanting journey through the vast universe of Machine Learning. I explored advanced topics, kept up with the forefront of innovation, and nurtured a deep passion for this dynamic field.
Beyond academia, I find joy in playing football, embarking on adventurous journeys, diving into captivating books, and indulging in mind-bending content from channels like [Numberphile](https://www.numberphile.com/) and [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).
I'm thrilled to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and ML. If you have an exciting opportunity or collaboration in mind, don't hesitate to reach out! Let's shape the future of technology together!
