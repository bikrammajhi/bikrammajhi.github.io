**I'm on the job market! Please reach out if you know of an opportunity that would fit my background.**

Hey there, I'm Bikram, a first year MTech. Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at IIT-Jodhpur. I'm all about the thrilling blend of Probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), where I dive deep into creating cutting-edge innovations that push the limits of Artificial Intelligence.


During my undergraduate years at IISER Kolkata, I had the privilege of working on a fascinating project at the renowned [MorphogenesisLab](https://sites.google.com/view/morphogenesis-lab-iiserkolkata/about-us?authuser=0) under Prof. Mohit Prasad. It was there that I discovered the pivotal role of early cancer detection, and the tremendous potential of Deep Learning in diagnosing cancer from images.

Fuelled by an unwavering quest for knowledge and skill enhancement, I immersed myself in specialized ML courses on platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), embarking on an exhilarating journey through the vast universe of Machine Learning. I delved into advanced topics, and cultivated a deep passion for this dynamic field.

Beyond academia, I find joy in playing football, embarking on thrilling adventures, devouring captivating books, and exploring mind-expanding content from channels like [Numberphile](https://www.numberphile.com/) and [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share my dedication to pushing the boundaries of AI and ML. If you have an exciting opportunity or collaboration in mind, I invite you to reach out! Together, let's shape the future of technology!
